# IN3110/IN4110 — Coursework Portfolio (Leah Hansen)

Welcome — this repository showcases my work for the University of Oslo course **IN4110: Problem Solving with High-Level Languages**. It contains a sequence of programming assignments that emphasize readable code, testing, reproducibility, and scientific computing practices.

## What you’ll find
- **Assignments 1–5** (`assignment1/`, `assignment2/`, …): Self-contained tasks demonstrating data processing, numerical methods, and software engineering patterns.


## Focus areas
- **Scientific Python:** NumPy, Pandas, plotting, and performance-aware code.
- **Software engineering:** Modular design, type hints, documentation strings, and CI-friendly structure.
- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic workflows, version control discipline, and environment management.

## How to navigate
- Start with the highest-numbered assignment for the most recent work.
- Each assignment folder includes a short README describing the task, inputs/outputs, and how to run tests.
